This thesis presents a comprehensive exploration of the integration of advanced text analysis techniques in the evaluation of tender documents within procurement processes. With organizations increasingly competing for contracts and striving to enhance their decision-making methods, the need for innovative data analysis tools is more pivotal than ever. This study specifically investigates the applicability of methodologies such as BERT embeddings and sentiment analysis to unravel the complexities inherent in tender submissions.
The research highlights the pivotal role of these advanced analytical techniques in extracting insights that not only improve tender evaluation outcomes but also enhance overall procurement efficiency and foster stronger vendor relationships. The application of machine learning and data analysis methods is crucial in transforming traditional procurement practices, enabling organizations to make more informed and timely decisions.
Additionally, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the existing literature on digital transformation in procurement while providing practical recommendations for organizations seeking to modernize their tender evaluation processes. By emphasizing the necessity of leveraging text analysis technology, the research outlines how it serves as a critical advancement in navigating the increasingly complex landscape of contemporary procurement environments. This work ultimately advocates for improved value creation in both public and private sector investments through the systematic adoption of text analysis in tender evaluation.
